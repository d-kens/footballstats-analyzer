Issues
1. Magic string comparisons: Done
2. Source of data is hardcoded: Done
3. Data array is all strings, even though we might numbers in it.
4. Variable named after a specific team
5. Analysis is type fixed 
6. No ability to ouput the report in different formats




* Enums 
    - A way to define a set of related named constants
    - Allow defination of a set of values that can be assigned to a variable.
    - Useful when you need to work with a predefined set options or states such as
        >  primary colors on a color picker.
        >  error levels
        > days of the week

* Array
    - A data structure that stores a collection elements in contigous memory locations.


* Tuple
    - The type of data in each position in a tuple is fixed once it is initialized.
    - Immutable: Its size and data type for each element cannot be changed.

    let tup: [string, number, boolean] = ['Onyango', 10, true]
    let student: [string, number];
    student = ['Onyango Dickens', 136980]
