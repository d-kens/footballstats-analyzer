Issues
1. Magic string comparisons: Done
2. Source of data is hardcoded: Done
3. Data array is all strings, even though we might numbers in it.
4. Variable named after a specific team
5. Analysis is type fixed 
6. No ability to ouput the report in different formats




* Enums 
    - A way to define a set of related named constants
    - Allow defination of a set of values that can be assigned to a variable.
    - Useful when you need to work with a predefined set options or states such as
        >  primary colors on a color picker.
        >  error levels
        > days of the week

* Array
    - Data structure to hold a collection of elements.
    - Dynamic in size: Elemeents can be added or removed.


* Tuple
    - An ordered collection of elements of fixed sizes and types.
    - Tuples are immutable: once defined the length and types of the elements in a tuple cannot be changed.
    - Useful when you want to work with a collection of values where the position in the collection is meaningful
